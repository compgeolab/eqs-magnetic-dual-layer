## About

This is the first paper of India's PhD thesis. It was motivated by our desire
to improve the currently available magnetic data products available for
Antarctica. We realised that more sophisticated methods of interpolating and
joining the different survey data were needed and that equivalent sources
was likely the way forward. These results serve as the basis for further
exploration into the challenging Antarctic magnetic datasets.

## Abstract

Magnetic data often require interpolation onto a regular grid at constant
height before further analysis. A widely used approach for this is the
equivalent sources technique, which has been adapted over time to improve its
computational efficiency and accuracy of the predictions. However, many of
these adaptations still face challenges, including border effects in the
predictions or reliance on a stabilising parameter. To address these
limitations, we introduce dual-layer gradient-boosted equivalent sources to:
(1) use a dual-layer approach to improve the predictions of both short- and
long-wavelength signals, as well as, reduce border effect; (2) use
block-averaging and the gradient-boosted equivalent sources method to reduce
the computational load; (3) apply block K-fold cross-validation to guide
optimal parameter selection for the model. The proposed method was tested on
both synthetic datasets and the ICEGRAV aeromagnetic dataset to evaluate the
methods ability to interpolate and upward continue onto a regular grid, as well
as predict the amplitude of the anomalous field from total-field anomaly data.
The dual-layer approach proved better compared to the single-layer approach
when predicting both short- and long-wavelength signals, particularly in the
presence of truncated long-wavelength anomalies. The use of block-averaging and
the gradient-boosting method enhances the computational efficiency, being able
to grid over 400,000 data points in under 2 minutes on a moderate workstation
computer.
